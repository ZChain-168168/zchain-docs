# January 21st 2022

## Summary

This test was done after the TxPool refactor which significantly improved performance (released in [v0.2.0](https://github.com/0xPolygon/polygon-edge/releases/v0.2.0)).

The goal was to setup a large network consisting of 30 actively participating validators in order to properly stress test the consensus and TxPool transaction gossiping as all transactions were sent to a single node's JSON-RPC.

Our aim was not to strive to reach a maximum possible TPS, as the network size negatively impacts the performance, and since block gas limit & block time are set to sane values that don't consume much system resources, and would allow this to run on commodity hardware.

## Results

| Metric                  | Value |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| Transactions per second | 344   |
| Transactions failed     | 0     |
| Transactions succeeded  | 10000 |
| Total run time          | 30s   |
